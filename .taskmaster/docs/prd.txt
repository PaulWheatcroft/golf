# Golf Game Enhancement Project PRD

## Project Overview
A two-player golf game that simulates a realistic golfing experience with turn-based gameplay, accurate distance calculations, and strategic shot management.

## Current State
- Functional two-player golf game
- Extended 16-row hole map (upgraded from 11 rows)
- Implemented distance calculation system
- Turn-based logic system with furthest player priority
- Continuous shot management
- Real-time status display
- Updated tee positions (row 15)
- All core tests passing except aim-selection tests

## Core Features Implemented
1. Distance Calculation System
   - findHolePosition
   - calculateEuclideanDistance
   - calculateDistanceFromHole
   - getPlayerDistanceFromHole
   - Map bounds validation

2. Turn-Based Logic System
   - Turn manager with 6 key functions
   - Furthest player from hole plays next
   - Stroke count tie-breaking
   - Green detection system

3. Game Flow Management
   - Continuous shot management
   - Enhanced game loop in main.ts
   - Real-time status display
   - Extended hole map dimensions
   - Updated test suite

## Immediate Requirements
1. Spacebar Shot Confirmation
   - Replace all shot confirmations with spacebar-only input
   - Update relevant UI elements
   - Maintain game flow integrity
   - Add appropriate feedback for player actions

2. Aim Selection Test Updates
   - Update all aim-selection tests to match new 16-row dimensions
   - Ensure compatibility with spacebar confirmation
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Add new edge cases for extended map

## Future Enhancements
1. UI/UX Improvements
   - Enhanced visual feedback
   - Clear player turn indicators
   - Shot power visualization
   - Improved status messages

2. Game Statistics
   - Track scores per hole
   - Calculate total strokes
   - Store best performances
   - Display player statistics

3. Advanced Features
   - Multiple hole courses
   - Different terrain types
   - Weather effects
   - Club selection impact

## Technical Requirements
- TypeScript implementation
- Jest test coverage
- Modular code structure
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria
1. All tests passing, including updated aim-selection tests
2. Smooth game flow with spacebar confirmation
3. Clear player feedback
4. Maintained code quality and test coverage
5. Enhanced user experience

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain existing code structure
- Follow established naming conventions
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Prioritize user experience
